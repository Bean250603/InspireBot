This is a bot I made for discord. It will post random quotes, when someone types /quote . Aswell as this, I wanted to add a function, for people who are upset or stressed, can feel as though there is someone to talk to, even if that is just a bot, therefore, when a word such as 'upset' or 'sad' is posted, the bot will reply with a kind message. 

What this means for the future?

I plan to make it so someone can use a command to add more quotes to the bot, which will be stored in the replit database. There is already some code in there, however, I have not had the time to finish it. Feel free to commit, or any issues, message me on discord @Bean#7983

I don't plan to add anything else to this, except for maybe adding new words that will trigger the bot to message, such as 'depressed', or 'sad'.
