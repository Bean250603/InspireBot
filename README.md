# InspireBot
This is a bot I made for discord. It will post random quotes, when someone types $inspire . Aswell as this, I wanted to add a function, for people who are upset or stressed, can feel as though there is someone to talk to, even if that is just a bot, therefore, when a word such as 'upset' or 'sad' is posted, the bot will reply with a kind message.
